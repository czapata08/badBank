<h1>MERN Three-Tiered Application - Fake Bank<br /></h1>
<h4>This project encompasses a fully functional three-tiered web application, inspired by a banking web app.</h4>
<p>This bank application is part of my final capstone project with the MITXPRO full-stack development course. My goal with this project is to show my ability to integrate a full-stack architecture, as well as fully, my decision-making process on designing the entire application, I designed this application following these steps:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>UI design and wireframe, implementation with ReactJS and Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Serve static files with Node.JS and Express.JS and dynamic files from the database, making it scalable and speed efficient</li>
    <li>Integrated and live MongoDB + Express dockerized database</li>
    <li>User Authentication with Firebase Google OAuth</li>
</ul>
